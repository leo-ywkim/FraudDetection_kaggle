# FraudDetection_kaggle
### Fraud prediction kaggle competition jupyter notebook code.  
I used *Light GBM* model with *Bayesian Optimization* for prediction.  
- `kg_submission_model.ipynb` : main analysis process code including preprocessing and model
- `kg_submission_ensemble.ipynb` : Ensemble the result of couple of ML methods to enhance performance of prediction
- `csv files` : sample data set (only 100 rows due to large volume)


from Business Modeling Analysis course (BME587, 21 Fall semester)
